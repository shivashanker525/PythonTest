Welcome to my project PythonTest
Here we are working on the technologies like automation using python 
Firstly we have to check out the possibilites of automating the given task in multiple ways 
Later we have to decide whether to choose which one.
So Finally we have to go with one logic and
We have to execute it to get it work done.
So we have to finalize the things whichever will be possible to get work done
I'm working with the commands which are very familiar to me in this project.
I think we can achieve the things on time by specific timelines.]
Make it possible to get on time
